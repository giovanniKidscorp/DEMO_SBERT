Ready to test your survival skills in the vast expanses of the ocean?\n\nRaft Survival: Ocean Nomad – is an adventure survival game on a raft in the ocean. Fight enemies in the ocean, craft all kinds of items and weapons, explore new territories and uninhabited islands.\nMany adventures are waiting for you: survival on the island, exploration of the ocean by boat, fishing and much more. You will have to try hard to survive in the post-apocalypse: hunting for sharks and extracting resources from the ocean, building and improving the Raft and creating armor to protect against the dangers of the ocean.\n\nFeatures of our game:\n\n☆ Hundreds of weapons and items;\n☆ Open world exploration;\n☆ Realistic 3D HD - graphics;\n☆ Survival on islands;\n☆ Improved raft building.\n\nTips for apocalypse survival:\n\n🌊 Catch items and resources with you hook\n\nChests and barrels floating around always contain vital resources for survival in the sea, and wreckages are really good material for raft building in ocean games. You might even find items, tools and weapons for defense of the raft, so keep on throwing the hook!\n\n🔫 Craft weapons and armor\n\nA prey can easily change the rules and become a hunter in shark games. Make a hard choice among hundreds of guns, two-handed blade weapons and armor parts to defend you floating base and hunt sharks. Craft a perfect arsenal and always be ready for the battle.\n\n⛵️ Defend your raft\n\nBe ready to evolve and fight for survival in the sea with a double effort, now that you’ve got one more problem to deal with. No man can tame a shark and there’s nowhere to escape, so prepare for shooting and swinging all night and day long!\n\n🔨 Build and upgrade\n\nPay attention to the condition of your raft on the water in survival RPG games in the ocean. It’s not enough to tie together a couple of wooden planks without a roof or even walls to feel safe. Be creative and expand the raft in height and width, because the only limit for building in survival simulator games is your imagination. There’s also a lot of upgrades for fishing, storage space extension, that you can improve the floating shelter with to help you survive in the ocean.\n\n Explore the ocean\n\nHave you ever wondered if there is a lost land with forests, jungle and animals in this endless ocean? An awesome feature of our island survival games is now implemented in this one. Don’t sit idle — dare to explore the ocean and islands around. What do they hide: horror or glory, medieval royale treasures or wild tigers and scary dinosaurs from the jurassic age or even an old airplane wreckage? What's more you can find resources, upgrades for the raft and other items on the islands. You won’t need a ship or an ark to sail to them in shark games — a simple boat will do, and let the stars be your guide.\n\n🌋 Learn the story of the apocalypse\n\nAn unknown devastating cataclysm turned the world into an endless ocean and last survivors are locked on scattered islands like in prison, dreaming of finding their home. The quest of our raft game is to find them and discover the truth of what happened, find other people who could survive and join them.\n\n Survive on a raft\n\nOur offline survival simulator game is full of evolved enemies, good survival items and other features that will surprise everybody.

The start will consist of you preparing the batter. This way you will have to use all the best ingredients at your disposal in order to ensure that the quality is nothing less than perfect. \n\nPour the sugar and the baking powder, together with the flour into a bowl and then crack open some eggs. Separate the yolks from the whites and proceed to add more ingredients together. You will be needing some butter to give it some smoothness to the taste, some salt to balance the sweetness and also a little bit of cocoa powder. \n\nTake the mixer and blend all of these together until there are no more lumps left and everything is homogenized. If you do this step right, the batter will cook evenly and you will have plenty of fun decorating it afterwards as you do not have to repair any imperfections. Pour the batter into the cooking tray and then you will place that into the oven to bake for just a few seconds, as time flies by when you are having fun. \n\nOnce the base is complete, you will then move to the decorating station where you will have lots of icings and other treats and sprinkles that can go on top. For this reason, you will place each princess on the top of the cake and then begin to make them look amazing. Choose the right color for the cake icing, the perfect match for it on the sides as well, add some lollipops and all sorts of decorative accents that will make the cake look even more special. \n\nThere are lots of things that will impress you during the time you will play, such as:\n-Hands on baking experience\n-Plenty of steps to each baking process\n-Accurate progression\n-Freedom to decorate the cake to your liking\n-Colorful and magical environment\n-Beautiful soundtrack to set the fantasy mood\n-Instructions that clearly remind you what to do",
